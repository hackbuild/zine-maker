# Introduction

Zine Maker is a focused, modern editor for designing print‑ready zines in the browser. It provides familiar editor interactions (selection, transform, layers, grouping, guides) and zine‑specific features (templates with correct imposition/export, fold/cut marks, page labels), while remaining simple enough for quick creative workflows.

- Audience: zinesters, artists, educators, and developers making printable mini‑books
- Formats: quarter‑fold (8‑page one‑sheet slit fold), half‑fold (4‑page), booklet (multi‑sheet, saddle stitch)
- Output: front/back PNGs and multi‑page PDF, correctly sized for printing at 100%

See 02-getting-started.md to set up and 03-user-guide.md to learn the workflow.
